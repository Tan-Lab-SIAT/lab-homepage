      Our brain is the most complicated organ in our body, which comprises billions of neurons and trillions of neuronal connections 
      with remarkable spatiotemporal specificity. Furthermore, it also comprises similar number of glia cells and complex 
      network of blood vessels that support neuronal networks. This highly complicated yet organized structure gives rise to all our 
      thoughts, emotions and actions. How is such a complicated structure established during development has been a central question 
      in neuroscience. Disruptions of brain development lead to numerous brain disorders, such as ASD, ADHD, and schizophrenia. 
      Regulation of brain wiring occurs at different scales from genome to behavior. We aim to reveal a unifying logic from nanoscale 
      to macroscale that underlies the brain wiring regulated by nature and nurture

          We have been committed to the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which genetic programs and postnatal 
          experience regulate brain development and plasticity. We discovered a new and evolutionarily conserved family of cell 
          adhesion molecules that are key regulators of the spatiotemporally specific assembly of visual and motor circuits in 
          Drosophila. We also elucidated the spatiotemporal rules by which visual experience in early life regulates the cell-type and 
          functional development/plasticity of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex, and revealed that experience regulates these 
          processes by establishing spatially graded expression of genes encoding cell adhesion molecules, which further determines cell 
          type identity and function. Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics has revealed spatially graded gene expression and cell 
          type continuum in the whole brain. We are setting up to study whether experience can regulate this spatial molecular and 
          cellular organization across brain areas. Furthermore, we are trying to relate this molecular and cellular architecture to 
          patterns of neuronal connectivity and physiology across brain regions, as well as animal behavior. Overall, these efforts 
          will establish a research system that can offer mechanistic insights across different scales with manipulation of single 
          variables (i.e. genetics vs envorinment). This will enable us to dig deep into clinical related findings discussed below.

          Abnormal brain development leads to neural developmental diseases such as ASD, ADHD, etc. 
          It has been accepted that genetic and environmental factors both contribute to these diseases. 
          However, we do not know the exact relationships between individual factors and disease phenotypes. 
          Recent establishment of several comprehensive databases from clinical cohort studies in the US and Europe, 
          and advances in multidimentional data analysis offer us an unprecedented opportunity to reveal quantitative insights into 
          this question, which will further provide research objects for mechanistic studies using above mentioned cross-scale research 
          system.

          Glaucoma and optic nerve injury are major causes of irreversible vision loss. 
          These diseases co-feature neuronal cell death and axon loss, resemblying brain degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s 
          Disease and Parkingson’s Disease. Furthermore, the eye is part of the central nervous system (CNS), although located far 
          away from the brain. Thus, regeneration of the visual pathway caused by these diseases can potentially provide insights into 
          treating other brain degenerative diseases. With relatively simple structure and tissue environment compared to the rest of the 
          brain, it is possible that breakthroughs on CNS regeneration will be made easier in the visual system. We are trying to apply 
          combinatorial strategies used during normal nervous system development, plus anti-inflammatory strategies to regenerate the 
          visual pathway, in both rodent and non-human primate models of glaucoma and optic nerve injury. Similar strategies has been 
          shown to successifully regenerate mouse spinal cord after injury, giving us more confidence in this research direction.
